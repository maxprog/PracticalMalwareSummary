# Solutions for lab 1 (page 27,28)

**NOTE: I will try to use Linux utilities** (such as [pev](http://pev.sourceforge.net), [wrestool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wrestool) and [Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)) **instead of the Windows tools which are mentioned in the book.**

## Lab 1-1 

1. *Upload the files to VirusTotal and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?*

Uploading the files on VirusTotal, the results are that Lab01-01.dll is flagged as malicious by 34 engines, and Lab01-01.exe by 41. Here are links to the reports for [Lab01-01.dll](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f50e42c8dfaab649bde0398867e930b86c2a599e8db83b8260393082268f2dba/detection) and [Lab01-01.exe](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/58898bd42c5bd3bf9b1389f0eee5b39cd59180e8370eb9ea838a0b327bd6fe47/detection).

2. *When were these files compiled?*

I used [pev](http://pev.sourceforge.net) to detect the timestamp of the compilation:

```
$ readpe Lab01-01.dll | grep "time stamp"
Date/time stamp:                 1292775398 (Sun, 19 Dec 2010 16:16:38 UTC)
$ readpe Lab01-01.exe | grep "time stamp"
Date/time stamp:                 1292775379 (Sun, 19 Dec 2010 16:16:19 UTC)
```

3. *Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?*

The output of `strings` on both the files does not include `LoadLibrary` or `GetProcAddress`. We can have confirmation that these are not packed by using [Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy):

```
$ diec Lab01-01.dll
PE: compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++(6.0)[msvcrt]
PE: linker: Microsoft Linker(6.0)[DLL32]
$ diec Lab01-01.exe
PE: compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++(6.0)[msvcrt]
PE: linker: Microsoft Linker(6.0)[DLL32]
```

If the given file is packed, the `diec` command would list the packer used in the output.

4. *Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?*

`pev` allows us to check the imported functions by using the `-i` flag, for instance:

```
$ readpe -i Lab01-01.dll

```

In order to make the blog post more readable, I'll summarize the findings and list only the interesting functions.

- Lab01–01.exe imports functions from `KERNEL32.dll` and `MSVCRT.dll`
- Lab01–01.dll imports functions from `KERNEL32.dll`, `MSVCRT.dll`, and `WS2_32.dll` 


`KERNEL32.dll` contains important functionalities (like access and edit memory and files), thus is a common DLL to import. It is interesting to note the presence of `FindFirstFileA` and `FindNextFileA` in Lab01–01.exe, and `CreateProcessA` in Lab01–01.dll.

`WS2_32.dll` is used for network functionalities, but in this case is imported by ordinals, thus we don't have many additional information.

5. *Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?*

Using `strings` on Lab01-01.exe file, we can see some interesting findings, such as:

- `kerne132.dll`
- `kernel32.dll`
- `C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll`
- `Kernel32.`
- `Lab01-01.dll`
- `C:\Windows\System32\Kernel32.dll` 
- `WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE` (my favorite)

In particular, we can assume the existence of the file named `kerne132.dll` (with a *1* instead of an *l*) for infected machines.

6. *What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?*

Using `strings` on Lab01-01.dll, we can see an IP address: `127.26.152.13`.

7. *What would you guess is the purpose of these files?*

Other interesting results running `strings` are: `exec`, `hello`, `CreateProcess` and `sleep`; which are names of functions. Based on the findings provided, we can say that these two files may be used to create a backdoor.

## Lab 1-2

1. *Upload the Lab01-02.exe file to VirusTotal. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?*

The file is considered malicious by 55 engines, [here is the report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c876a332d7dd8da331cb8eee7ab7bf32752834d4b2b54eaa362674a2a48f64a6/detection).

2. *Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.*

Detect It Easy finds that UPX has been used in this case:

```
$ diec Lab01-02.exe 
PE: packer: UPX(3.04)[NRV,best]
PE: compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++(6.0)[-]
PE: linker: Microsoft Linker(6.0)[EXE32,console]
```

We can then proceed to unpack the file with the following command:

```
$ upx -d -o Lab01-02_unpacked.exe Lab01-02.exe

                       Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
                          Copyright (C) 1996 - 2020
UPX git-d7ba31+ Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser   Jan 23rd 2020

        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
     16384 <-      3072   18.75%    win32/pe     Lab01-02_unpacked.exe

Unpacked 1 file.
```

3. *Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?*

As shown in the previous exercise, we can use `readpe -i` to check the imported functions. Here are the interesting findings:

- `KERNEL32.DLL`: `SystemTimeToFileTime`, `GetModuleFileNameA`, `CreateMutexA`, `CreateThread` and `SetWaitableTimer`
- `ADVAPI32.DLL`: `CreateServiceA`, `StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA` and `OpenSCManagerA`
- `WININET.DLL`: `InternetOpenUrlA` and `InternetOpenA`

In particular, the last DLL file suggests that the file is communicating over the Internet.

4. *What host or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?*

Again, `strings` is our friend: `MalService`, `Malservice`, `HGL345`,`http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com` and `Internet Explorer 8.0`. These results are suggesting that the file is creating a service (probably `MalService`?) and connecting to the URL.

## Lab 1-3

1. *Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to VirusTotal. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?*

Lab01-03.exe is detected as malicious by 64 engines, [here is the report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7983a582939924c70e3da2da80fd3352ebc90de7b8c4c427d484ff4f050f0aec/detection).

2. *Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.*

Scanning the file with `diec` shows that it is packed with FSG 1.0: 

```
$ diec Lab01-03.exe 
PE: packer: FSG(1.0)[-]
PE: linker: unknown(0.0)[EXE32,console]
```

Unfortunately it is not possible (AFAIK) to unpack it with `upx`, thus I cannot proceed:

```
$ upx -d Lab01-03.exe 
                       Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
                          Copyright (C) 1996 - 2020
UPX git-d7ba31+ Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser   Jan 23rd 2020

        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
upx: Lab01-03.exe: NotPackedException: not packed by UPX

Unpacked 0 files.
```
 
3. *Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?*

Being still packed, we have limited visibility on Lab01–03.exe. We can only see that it imports `KERNEL32.DLL` and uses the following functions: `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress`. 

```
$ readpe -i Lab01-03.exe 
Imported functions
    Library
        Name:                            KERNEL32.dll
        Functions
            Function
                Hint:                            0
                Name:                            LoadLibraryA
            Function
                Hint:                            0
                Name:                            GetProcAddress
```

4. *What host or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?*

In this case, `strings` does not help us a lot, because the file is packed.
Again we see `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress`. Some of the other strings seems to refer to [OLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding).

## Lab 1-4

1. *Upload the Lab01-04.exe file to VirusTotal. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?*

The file is detected as malicious by 61 engines, [here is the report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0fa1498340fca6c562cfa389ad3e93395f44c72fd128d7ba08579a69aaf3b126/detection).

2. *Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.*

The file does not seem to be packed:

```
$ diec Lab01-04.exe 
PE: compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++(6.0)[msvcrt]
PE: linker: Microsoft Linker(6.0*)[EXE32]
```

3. *When was this program compiled?*

The time stamp reported seems suspicious 🤔, considering that the book was published in 2012:

```
$ readpe Lab01-04.exe | grep "time stamp"
    Date/time stamp:                 1567204019 (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 22:26:59 UTC)
```

It was probably modified, thus it's not clear when the file was actually compiled.

4. *Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?*

Here are the imports found with `readpe -i`:

- `ADVAPI32.dll`: `AdjustTokenPrivileges`, `LookupPrivilegeValueA` and `OpenProcessToken`.
- `KERNEL32.dll`: `CreateRemoteThread`, `MoveFileA`, `SizeofResource`, `LoadResource`, `GetModuleHandleA`, `OpenProcess`, `GetWindowsDirectoryA`, `WriteFile`, `GetCurrentProcess`, ` CreateFileA`, `GetProcAddress`, `FindResourceA`, `LoadLibraryA` and `WinExec`.

Considering the functions used, we can say that the program will try to access protected files (`SizeOfResource`, `FindResource`, `LoadResource`, `LookupPrivilegeValueA` and `AdjustTokenPrivilages`) and create and execute files (`CreateFile`, `WriteFile` and `WinExec`).


5. *What host or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?*

Here are the host and network-based indicators that can be found using `strings`:
- **host-based**: `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wupdmgrd.exe` and `winup.exe`
- **network-based**: `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe`

6. *This file has one resource in the resource section. Use Resource Hacker to examine that resource, and then use it to extract the resource. What can you learn from the resource?*

We can list and extract the resources from a Windows binary using `wrestool`:

```
$ wrestool -l Lab01-04.exe 
--type='BIN' --name=101 --language=1033 [offset=0x4060 size=16384]
$ wrestool -x --raw --output=Lab01-04.bin Lab01-04.exe
```

- [VirusTotal report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/819b2db1876d85846811799664d512b2f1af13e329f5debe60926c3b03424745/detection)
- Not packed:
```
$ diec Lab01-04.bin 
PE: compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++(6.0)[msvcrt]
PE: linker: Microsoft Linker(6.0)[EXE32]
```

- Compiled on `1298765819 (Sun, 27 Feb 2011 00:16:59 UTC)`.
- Imports: `KERNEl32.dll` (`WinExec`) and `urlmon.dll` (`URLDownloadToFileA`)
- Interesting strings: `\system32\wupdmgr.exe`, `winup.exe` and `www.malwareanalysisbok.com/updater.exe`

Considering the information obtained, we can assume that the Lab01-04.exe file will be used to change permissions to write in a directory and drop and execute the hidden resource, which contacts the network to download and run additional malware.
